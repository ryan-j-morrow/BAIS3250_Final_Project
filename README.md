*Professor: Michael Redmond*

## Overview  
This repository contains all code, outputs, and writeups associated with Ryan Morrowâ€™s final project for **BAIS:3250 â€“ Data Wrangling**, taught in the Spring 2025 semester at The University of Iowa Tippie College of Business.

## Path and File Descriptions  
All files (besides this `README.md`) are stored in the `05 Final Project` main folder and are organized as follows:

---

### ðŸ“‚ `00 Documents`  
This folder contains all writeup files required for submission.

- **`01 Project Proposal.docx`** â€” Project proposal submitted.
- **`02 Check In Presentation.pptx`** â€” Check-in assignment slides submitted.
- **`03 Final Report.docx`** â€” Final report submitted.

---

### ðŸ“‚ `01 Code Books`  
This folder stores all Jupyter notebooks containing the Python code that generated the outputs.

- **`01 Tickers.ipynb`** â€” Reads input ticker symbol files and creates the list of unique ticker symbols for analysis.
- **`02 Scraping Capitol Trades.ipynb`** â€” Scrapes individual trade data from the web in batches and saves each subset to a CSV.
- **`03 Data Integration.ipynb`** â€” Combines all raw data subsets, filters for valid tickers, matches trades (earliest buy & latest sell for each Ticker + Person pair), and removes unmatched trades.
- **`04 YFinance.ipynb`** â€” Uses YFinance API to collect stock prices on Buy/Sell dates and compiles the final dataset.
- **`05 Analysis.ipynb`** â€” Runs all analyses and generates visualizations from the final dataset.
